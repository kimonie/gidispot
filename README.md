UPDATE: This is a learning project
I've been able to learn a lot in this process and I have been able to see some basics steps I need to work on. but most importantly, I will love to see this project go live

Off to debug, but will need to stay consistent at my coding classes.

Interesting fact: You might a coded a lot at the backend before you realise your code is bugful, but it's beautiful when both frontend and backend connects.
